### Template Language
```html 
   {{> templage_name }} 

   {{>   -- means start of template replace mane and is closed by }}

   {{ is for global variables }}  

   the big difference is the ">" which means it is template 
 

   // Dynmaic html Language
   "**" is the start for a keyword 
   "**for"  is a for loop similar to how angulage does it 
   

   <div **for="var x in list">  -- x is only in scope until the end of the tag
     {{ x }} 
   </div> 
```
